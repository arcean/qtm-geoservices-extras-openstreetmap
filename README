OpenStreetMap (openstreetmap)
============================

API
---
OpenStreetMap creates and provides free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them.
The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical
restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive, or unexpected ways.
